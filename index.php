            You are cute bundle of joy to me. 

            YES I AM TELLING YOU NOW THAT I LOVE YOU AT FIRST SIGHT ❤️💕💗💖

             you are so adorable, cute, beautiful, charming, gorgeous, hardworking, loving, respectful and awesome.</span>

            Then after quick two months, this is what I think of her now... LOL

            <p>
            The day we talked first time, I never even thought that we are made for each others. 
            I actually dont even realize when I started loving you. May be I said it late. 
            At that time I was afraid to lose you but when we talked and you were sad, 
            I couldnt stop my self because I love you so much that I cant see you in any pain. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Now after so many days Its felt the same. Our love grows each and every day. 
            I am so proud of you. I know youre going through tough time but you are not alone now. 
            I am always with you now and forever. 
            Tough time actually shows who you are and I loved every bit of you. 
            I have never ever felt this strong connection / love / affection / attraction towards any one. 
            You my love on other hand, have all my love, affection, attraction and most importantly my precious HEART ❤️. 
            To be honest I dont need it back, because I know you will never break it.
            </p>

            <p>
            In such a sort time, I have seen a lot of dreams but 
            I didnt share with you because I dont want to create unnecessary pressure on you. 
            I have dreams that you came here and start studying. 
            We are living together enjoying every single moment of our life. 
            You are focusing in study and I am in my work. Every day in evening, 
            we go for a walk to get some fresh air and talked about our day. 
            We cook together, have fun in kitchen every day. 
            A lot of naughty things we do. Eventually you also like what 
            I am keep telling you about. Kissing you and hugging you is pretty normal. 
            Eventually you will finish your studies and gets a great job. 
            I am proud of you now but I will be more proud at that time that you achieved your goal.
             Now we both are working and planning to get a home OUR HOME 🏡. 
             Actually there are many more dreams. Most of them are really really bright. 
             And of course I am not immune with over thinking so I got some bad one also. 
             But I dont care about those. I am trying to be the best I can for you. 
             I will always protect you from any harm. 
             You dont need to worry about what will happen and how we will be getting through. 
             Just trust the universe trust the god, we didnt do anything wrong so I am not afraid of anything.
            </p>

            <p>
            I talked a lot about how I started loving you, what I feel and my dreams. 
            But all of those cant happen without YOU - MY LOVE 🫂❤️. 
            You are so perfect for me that I cant even describe. Your energy, your smile, 
            the way to care about people you love, the way you showing your love, your truthfulness, 
            your passion, your behavior - everything is perfect for me. Most 
            importantly we share each other everything. We talked and resolved the problem and that will definitely help 
            in future as problems will come, it our understanding that will help us to tackle it. 
            I know you will always be with me in any situation.
            I love you so much shivuuu.
            </p>
